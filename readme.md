# PlayNite Watcher Script

The PlayNite Watcher Script is a script that helps to end the Sunshine stream automatically when a specified PlayNite Launched game is closed.
It is intended to be used in conjunction with the Sunshine App Export extension which can be found on the [Playnite Add-ons page](https://playnite.link/addons.html). 

## Installation Instructions

1. Install the Sunshine App Export extension in PlayNite. You can do this by going to the [Playnite Add-ons page](https://playnite.link/addons.html) and searching for the "Sunshine App Export", then clicking "Download".
2. In PlayNite, select the applications that you wish to have added to Sunshine (if not added already), then click on the "Controller" menu button in the top left and go to "Extensions" -> "Sunshine App Export" -> "Export selected games".
3. Click on the PlayNite Menu button again then click on Settings -> Scripts.
4. Paste the contents of OnEndScript.ps1 to the "Execute after exiting a game" block.
5. Double click on the "Install.bat" file to open up a UI form that allows you to select which games you want to install the script on.
6. Checkmark each game you would like to have Sunshine end the stream on when it is closed.
7. Once you have finished selecting the games, click on the "Install" button.

Please note that this script is an early version and may contain bugs that will be fixed as they are discovered.
